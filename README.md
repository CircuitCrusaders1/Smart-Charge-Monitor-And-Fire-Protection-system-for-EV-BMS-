Smart Charge Monitor And Fire Protection system for EV BMS.
Project description - Most electric vehicle fire incidents occur due to battery blast or fire. So here we attempt to solve the problem by using some sensors and battery pack based system powered by an STM32 controller. The system is designed to protect batteries from various parameters that may incite a fire. The system is designed to constantly monitor battery voltage current temperature and instantly cut off the input or output from battery as soon as any unusual behavior is detected.
